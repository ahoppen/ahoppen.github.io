### Swift
I am an active [committer](https://github.com/apple/swift/pulls?q=author%3Aahoppen%20) to the Swift compiler and this is basically the reason for this page, where I wanted to share some of my insights into the Swift compiler.

### Student

I am a Computer Science student at RWTH Aachen University and will finish with my Bachelor's degree this August. 

Starting in September, I will study at the University of Edinburgh for one year.

### ATeamer.de

As a side project I develop [ATeamer.de](https://www.ateamer.de), an online tool that allows teams to organise themselves more easily, but which is unfortunately only available in German.
