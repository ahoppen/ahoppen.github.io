To run a single test for the Swift compiler you need to update your `$PATH` variable to include your locally build Swift executables. For me that was 

```
export PATH=/Users/Alex/Documents/Developer/swift/build/Xcode-DebugAssert/swift-macosx-x86_64/Debug/bin/:$PATH
```

Afterwards you can run a single test or the tests in one directory using the `run-test` script in `swift/utils`.

```
swift/utils/run-test --build-dir build/Xcode-DebugAssert/ path/to/dir/or/file/to/test
```
